# Interview-Scheduler-Website
A website that makes interview scheduling work easier
Our Interview Scheduling Platform is designed to streamline the interview scheduling process by using an intelligent, priority-based algorithm to manage interview slots efficiently. The platform optimizes the scheduling experience for both interviewers and candidates, reducing wait times and improving resource utilization.

Key Features Priority-Based Scheduling: The platform assigns priority levels to interview requests based on criteria such as urgency, candidate importance, and other relevant factors. Higher priority requests are scheduled first to ensure timely interviews.

Dynamic Slot Allocation: Available interview slots are dynamically allocated to optimize scheduling, minimizing wait times and ensuring that resources (such as interviewers and rooms) are fully utilized.

User-Friendly Interface: The platform offers an intuitive interface, making it easy for users to: Submit interview requests. View scheduled interview slots. Receive notifications for upcoming interviews. Efficient Resource Management: By automating the scheduling process, the platform ensures that interviews are organized in a way that maximizes both interviewer and candidate availability.

Benefits For Interviewers: Easily manage your interview schedule with minimal manual intervention. For Candidates: Get timely notifications and avoid long wait times by having your interview scheduled based on priority. For Administrators: Optimize interview slot usage and reduce the chances of double-booking or resource conflicts. How It Works Request Submission: Interview requests are submitted by candidates or administrators with relevant details (e.g., urgency, candidate type, preferred time). Priority Assignment: Each request is assigned a priority based on predefined criteria. Dynamic Slot Allocation: The system dynamically allocates available slots based on the priority of requests, available resources, and the interviewer's schedule. Notifications: Once an interview is scheduled, all parties receive timely notifications about their upcoming interview.
